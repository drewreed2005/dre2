<div class="title-header">Welcome to Drew's CSA Blog!</div>

After learning to code-code-code in CSP, Drew makes his grand return in CSA to code even more cool stuff.

## Who is Drew?

</div>

I'm a guy from San Diego, California. I was born in Palm Springs, but I moved here when I was 2. Here are some of my interests:
- Code Code Code
- Playing guitar
- Producing music
- Theatre
- Language learning

## What has Drew made?

I (Drew) have made many things using my code-code-coding skills, including...
- [The Work Watch](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/workwatchbeta)
    - A stopwatch program that encourages healthy work sessions by instructing when to take breaks. I coded the timer functionality and created the alarms, among other things.
- [Cafe Gato](https://drewreed2005.github.io/cafegato/)
    - A cat cafe website with lots of experimental pages that act as a sort of bizarre marketing campaign. I was responsible for the [events page](https://drewreed2005.github.io/cafegato/events), which allows users to schedule events at the cafe. The events database is no longer active.
- [DVASS Casino](https://srihitakott1213.github.io/DVASS/)
    - A card game website that simulates various common card games. It's a great place to visit when you're bored. I was responsible for coding [Blackjack](https://srihitakott1213.github.io/DVASS/blackjack/), [Uno](https://srihitakott1213.github.io/DVASS/uno/) and the [leaderboard](https://srihitakott1213.github.io/DVASS/leaderboard/). The leaderboard database is no longer active.
- Miscellaneous other fun stuff
    - A 15-question survey with adaptive responses to each question and a bizarre twist. This was one of my first code endeavors.
    - A text-based RPG that runs in the console with Python. Mainly used to test playing and looping music with Python libraries.
    - A JavaScript-HTML-CSS classic RPG boss battle with animations.
    - A life sim game using AI-generated art backgrounds, mostly made to take advantage of JavaScript `async` functions.

Outside of class, I've coded some small game projects using GameMaker Studio.
