    "- Explain Anatomy of a Class in comments of a program (Diagram key parts of the class).\n",
    "- Comment in code where there is a definition of a Class and an instance of a Class (ie object)\n",
    "- Comment in code where there are constructors and highlight the signature difference in the signature\n",
    "- Call an object method with parameter (ie setters).\n",

    "Additional requirements\n",
    "1. Go through code progression of understanding Class usage and generating an Instance of a Class (Object). \n",
    "    a. Build a purposeful dynamic Class, using an Object, generate multiple instances:\n",
    "        - Person: Name and Age\n",
    "        - Dessert: Type and Cost\n",
    "        - Location: City, State, Zip\n",
    "    b. Create a static void main tester method to generate objects of the class.\n",
    "    c. In tester method, show how setters/mutators can be used to make the data in the Object dynamically change\n",
    "\n",
    "I did this by having users initially created in a Person database that can be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go through progression of understanding a Static Class.  Build a purposeful static Class, no Objects.\n",
    "    - Calculate common operations on a Date field, age since date, older of two dates, number of seconds since date\n",
    "    - Calculate stats functions on an array of values: mean, median, mode.\n",

    "I did this a ton with my updated console games hacks, but I decided to also make an object that \n",
