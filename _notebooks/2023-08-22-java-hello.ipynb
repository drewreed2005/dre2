    "This example starts to use Java in its natural manner, using an object within the main method. This example is a very basic illustration of Object Oriente Programming (OOP). The main method is now used as a driver/tester, by making an instance of the class.  Thus, it creates an Object using the HelloObject() constructor.  Also, this Class contains a getter method called getHello() which returns the value with the \"String hello\".\n",

The \"this\" keyword helps in clarification between instance and local variable.\n",
